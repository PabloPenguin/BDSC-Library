# BDSC-Library
An assignment on creating and managing a library database systems. We utilized PHP, css, HTML, SQL, and used the DBMS MySQL.

This was an extremely fun assignment to do from my highschool because of all the different languages we used. Seeing how my website was able to directly communicate with my database was a great feeling!

Next time I hope to focus on the security aspect more, as the database + login of this website was not encrypted at all.
